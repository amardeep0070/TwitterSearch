Simple search engine to which internally indexes the given tweets and then provides search funtionality for those.
The indexing portion is similar to elastic search, It uses mapping of words and documents to create the index and the uses
then TF-IDF model to calculate the relevence order for the search results.

This uses a MVC model with the use of AngularJS, NodeJS , HTML and JS :)
